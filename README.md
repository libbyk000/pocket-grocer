# pocket-grocer

### Project Description
Pocket Grocer is a web application that empowers individuals, as well as those living in communal living spaces, to keep track of grocery items and respective expiration dates in order to minimize their food waste. The 3 main operational use cases with which this application aims to help users are:
1. Keeping track of their groceries in both the fridge and pantry
2. Creating household "groups" in which they can add other users, and see and share the items in that household
3. Filtering and sorting the items in their grocery inventory
