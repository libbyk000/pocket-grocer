### **Progress** 

Libby:  Wrote ½ of testing suite for front end beta release code. Updated README. Wrote developer guidelines. Wrote user manual
Fadel:  Wrote ½ of testing suite for front end beta release code. Fixed quantity for addItem. Finished the account page to display housemate/groupmates dynamically (connected to backend)
Sophia: Updated documentation (Api calls, requirements and policies) to reflect any changes we made to the architecture and SQL table schema. Created skeleton for User and Developer documentation, walked through the assignment with the backend developers and delegated sections to team members, and completed the User documentation. 
Myka: Updated SQL statements in API calls document to reflect current table columns, created new testing tables on Azure and created a QueryTest.java class for testing Query in order to not disrupt the real data on Azure. Added additional test cases to TestQuery.java and made sure all tests were passing. Added to User and Developer documentation with testing information. 
Tushar:
