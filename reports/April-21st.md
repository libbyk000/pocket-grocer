## **_Contributions of individual team members_**

### **Last week’s plan**

- Libby: Work with Fadel and add mobile friendly template to repo, choose general CSS palette, start to implement the all items page
- Fadel: Start to implement the welcome page and user login page
- Sophia: Design a better structured outline for the weekly reports, help set up Azure and figure out the best approach to incorporating our tables/changing and access the data
- Myka: Start to set up Azure for the backend, get more familiar with git and determine a protocol with other team members for using git together to minimize future issues.
- Tushar: Will begin to set up Azure for the backend. Will try to make a running database ready to query things, and show the required items on the webapp.
- Shuarya: Work on setting up a backend on Azure. Understand the database we would need to create for our project.
 
### **Progress** 
- Libby: Found and added mobile friendly template to repo, got basic HTML/CSS set up for the login page, sign in page, all items page, add item page
- Fadel: Implemented home page and set up UI palette
- Sophia: Made a list of the Tables we need, and justified the values we would need for each table, worked on API endpoints document
- Myka: Started setting up Azure w/Backend team, created a md report template, worked on API endpoints document  
- Tushar: Worked on connecting the API with the Azure SQL Database using the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API. Used the API endpoint document to decide on the data that will be stored in the application. Setup an Azure resource group and added the Tables for storing the app data.
- Shaurya: Decided on the backend stack to create, deploy, and host the backend. Created a document for the API outline and decided on the endpoints. Looked into using Spring Boot with Java to send and receive the HTTP requests from the backend.
 
### **Next week’s plan**  
- Libby: Finish add items page, implement item page
- Fadel: Add select options for filter and sort to all items page (make flex), start looking into testing, add error messaging, create custom.js (module pattern) and hook up to all pages
- Sophia: Finalize the list of tables, help implement the next APi endpoints (Create Account, Delete Account, Create Group, Add Member to group)
- Myka: Finalize list of tables, help implement API endpoints
- Shaurya: Set up the API architecture using Java and Spring Boot to begin sending and receiving HTTP requests. Deploy an under development test version of the API.
- Tushar: Set up the Azure SQL database and incorporate the JDBC API in the API architecture to interact with the database.
